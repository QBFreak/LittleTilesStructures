- [CheapOfficeChair.txt](CheapOfficeChair.txt?raw=true) - A cheap office chair. Looks kinda uncomfortable. I'm glad I don't have to sit in it. 32-voxel grid.

- [Cinderblock.txt](Cinderblock.txt?raw=true) - A cinderblock, for all your holding it down, holding it up, and throwing needs. Wait. No. Don't throw it. Not at me!

![Cinderblock](Cinderblock.png)

- [Cinderblock-basic.txt](Cinderblock-basic.txt?raw=true) - A low-tile version of the cinderblock. Because yeah, you're that cheap.

- [DraftingTableStand.txt](DraftingTableStand.txt?raw=true) - A stand for the Immersive Vehicles (MTS) Drafting Table. IMO it looks silly sitting way down there on the floor. A good companion for this is the Stool.

- [Drywall.txt](Drywall.txt?raw=true) - It's a sheet of drywall. No tape. No mud. Just some screws to hold it up. Yeah, a few of em are crooked. Just like when I do drywall IRL...

- [GarageDoor.txt](GarageDoor.txt?raw=true) - A simple Garage Door that opens upwards six blocks after sliding inwards one block. Axis is the lower left. Requires Chisel.

- [GarageDoorTrack.txt](GarageDoorTrack.txt?raw=true) - Some track for the Garage Door so it doesn't just float in mid air when it's open.

- [ImmersivePalette.txt](ImmersivePalette.txt?raw=true) - A collection of tiles in colors and materials I use for building structures to compliment Immersive Engineering and related mods. Uses only LittleTiles blocks. Each 3x3 (@16) tile is a named structure to give a clue as to what that material was originally designed for. Ignore that extra white tile. I needed something to put it in a new recipe.
