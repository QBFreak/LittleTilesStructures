# LittleTiles exports

These are various LittleTiles exports that I've made.

- GarageDoor.txt - A simple Garage Door that opens upwards six blocks after sliding inwards one block. Axis is the lower left. Requires Chisel.
- GarageDoorTrack.txt - Some track for the Garage Door so it doesn't just float in mid air when it's open.
- MetalRungLadder.txt - The horizontal equivalent to the `Metal Rung Ladder` from Engineer's Decor. Purely decorative. 32-voxel grid. Requires Immersive Engineering (Steel Block).
